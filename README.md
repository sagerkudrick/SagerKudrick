## 📖 3D Magazine Pipeline 

<table>
<tr>
<td width="55%">

A stylized **Blender-based rendering system** that scrapes, processes, and animates vintage gaming magazines into rotating, transparent 3D models.

> 🔒 Core assets (models, templates) are private to preserve originality.

- 🗂️ Scrapes 90s–2000s **PDF magazines** from web archives and converts pages into texture images  
- 📘 Maps pages onto a **custom 3D magazine mesh** for animated previews and renders  
- 🧠 Includes an interactive **page selection interface** to choose any two pages for the rendered book
- 🛠️ Streamlines page swapping and batch rendering into a fully automated pipeline
